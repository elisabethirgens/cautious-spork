I’m reading [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/) and practicing other tasks along the way. Here are some posts where I’m explaining to myself what I’m trying to do:

[Make Three in a Row, Part 1](https://elisabethirgens.github.io/notes/2018/02/game/)

[Make Three in a Row, Part 2](https://elisabethirgens.github.io/notes/2018/03/game/)
